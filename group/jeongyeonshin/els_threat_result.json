We assessed these measures using items from the ABCD Family Environment Scale-Family Conflict Subscale (Smith et al., 2010; modified to include items assessing parental conflict style), the ABCD Neighborhood Safety/Crime Survey-Safety from Crime Subscale (Jones et al., 2012; modified to exclude items related to gang activity), and the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS; Kaufman et al., 1997) - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder section, with reports from parents and youth where applicable. We binary coded all items (1 = event experienced, 0 = event not experienced) and summed the binary coded items within each threat measure to create a total score for that measure. Cronbach's alpha was calculated using SPSS version 27.\n\nWe assessed sexual abuse with three items (α = .82), including: 'A grown-up in the home touched your child in their privates, had your child touch their privates, or did other sexual things to your child.' We assessed physical abuse with five items (α = .78), such as: 'Shot, stabbed, or beaten brutally by a non-family member' and 'A family member threatened to kill your child.' We measured domestic violence, distinct from physical abuse that directly targets the child, using both youth and parent-reported items (α = .75), such as: 'Family members sometimes hit each other.'\n\nOther forms of trauma, including non-interpersonal trauma, were assessed with six items (α = .80), including experiencing a car accident, witnessing a natural disaster, or war. We evaluated community violence/safety with four items (α = .72), such as: 'Witnessed someone shot or stabbed in the community' and 'I feel safe walking in my neighborhood, day or night.' In summary, we used a comprehensive set of measures to assess various forms of threat exposure in our sample.",
