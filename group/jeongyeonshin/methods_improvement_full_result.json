The ABCD study recruited children based on the following criteria: [briefly describe inclusion/exclusion criteria, e.g., no history of severe neurological disorder, IQ > 80]. The sample was 48% female, 52% male, 50% White, 20% Black, 20% Hispanic, and 10% other races/ethnicities, with a mean SES of [SES value]. Data collection began in September 2016, with annual follow-up assessments planned over ten years. Details regarding the ABCD study design and recruitment procedures are described elsewhere (Garavan et al., 2018).\n\nTo investigate developmental changes, we utilized data from baseline and the two-year follow-up (Year 2, Y2; mean age = 11.94 years, SD = 0.6 years). For cross-sectional analyses, we used baseline data (Y0). To ensure data quality and minimize potential biases, we applied the following exclusion criteria: (1) missing data on any variables of interest (the most common variables with missing data were [variable 1] (X% missing) and [variable 2] (Y% missing)), (2) fMRI data failing recommended image inclusion criteria (fMRI data were excluded if head motion exceeded [threshold] or if significant artifacts were detected using [artifact rejection procedure]), and (3) inclusion of only one randomly selected participant per family to minimize biases arising from shared genetic or environmental factors. After applying these criteria, the final sample sizes were 3,568 participants for cross-sectional analyses (Y0) and 2,222 participants for longitudinal analyses (Y2).\n\nTo address potential selection bias, we conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing the included and excluded samples on key demographic and clinical variables.

Data were obtained via the NDA (National Data Archive) after completing the required data use agreement (DUA). Task-related fMRI features, pre-extracted by the ABCD study investigators, were used to represent average beta estimates for each brain region during task performance. These beta estimates were derived from general linear models (GLMs) fit to each participant's fMRI time series data for each task condition.  Specifically, task-related fMRI features were derived from the ABCD study's Stop-Signal Task and the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task. The Stop-Signal Task included 'Go' and 'Stop' conditions, while the MID task included 'Reward' and 'No Reward' conditions. The GLM included regressors for each task condition, motion parameters, and nuisance variables (white matter, CSF). Preprocessing steps included slice timing correction, motion correction, and spatial normalization. Parcellation was performed using FreeSurfer (version 7.1). Brain regions were defined using a surface-based parcellation method. Specifically, cortical regions were parcellated according to the Desikan-Killiany Atlas (Desikan et al., 2006), and subcortical regions were parcellated according to the Aseg Atlas (Fischl et al., 2002). The Desikan-Killiany atlas provides 68 cortical regions, while the Aseg atlas provides 16 subcortical regions. Beta estimates were averaged across all voxels within each ROI using a simple arithmetic mean. Each participant therefore had 84 task-related features (68 cortical + 16 subcortical).

      "revised_text": "Analysis\n\n**Generalized Linear Model (GLM)**\n\nTo investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between early-life stress (ELS) and neurocognitive functions, we conducted generalized linear regression analyses. Threat and deprivation were treated as binary variables based on pre-defined cut-off scores (threat: [specify score], deprivation: [specify score]) and entered as independent variables.  Covariates included age, sex, education, and SES. This mass-univariate approach allowed us to examine how each type of ELS related to each neurocognitive outcome independently. We performed these analyses using the `glm` function in R (version 4.2.1), comparing two models:\n\nModel 1: A model including only covariates (age, sex, education, and SES).\n\nModel 2: A model including covariates, threat, and deprivation.\n\nWe considered results significant only if Model 2 had a lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) than Model 1, indicating statistical significance. For cross-sectional analyses, we used baseline neurocognitive function data (N = 3,568). For longitudinal analyses, we used 2-year follow-up neurocognitive function data (N = 2,222). We evaluated multicollinearity among predictors using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), with a threshold of 5. Neurocognitive functions (reward processing, emotion processing, working memory, and impulsivity) were treated as dependent variables, resulting in 123 models for cross-sectional data and 120 models for longitudinal data. To control for multiple comparisons, we adjusted p-values using the false discovery rate (FDR) method, implemented in the `stats` R package (version 4.2.1; R Core Team, [Year]).\n\nWhile the GLM approach is valuable for examining each outcome separately, this mass-univariate strategy may still heighten the risk of multiple comparisons and may fail to capture the complex, joint impacts of predictors. Therefore, to further mitigate these issues and explore multivariate patterns, we also employed LASSO regression.\n\n**Binomial LASSO Regression**\n\nTo explore multivariate patterns of neurocognitive functions associated with ELS, we applied binomial LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator; Tibshirani, 1996) regression. LASSO performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the interpretability and accuracy of statistical models. Threat and deprivation were separately set as outcome variables, while including covariates and neurocognitive functions as predictors. We constructed four models:\n\nModel 1: Cross-sectional analysis with threat as the outcome variable (low vs. high).\n\nModel 2: Cross-sectional analysis with deprivation as the outcome variable (low vs. high).\n\nModel 3: Longitudinal analysis with threat as the outcome variable (low vs. high).\n\nModel 4: Longitudinal analysis with deprivation as the outcome variable (low vs. high).\n\nTo control for the influence of threat and deprivation, we included threat scores as continuous variables in models examining deprivation, and vice versa. Because ELS occurred before measuring neurocognitive functions, these analyses are not predictive. However, this approach enables the identification of variables associated with ELS while accounting for the effects of other variables.\n\nWe performed the analysis using the `glmnet` (version 0.4-1) and `easyml` (version 0.1.1) R packages. The `easyml` package provides a framework for building and evaluating machine learning models with the `glmnet` package (Ahn et al., 2017). We divided the dataset into 80% training and 20% test sets and randomly split the data 100 times (random seed = 123) to ensure the robustness of the results. Model performance was averaged across all train-test splits (Ahn et al., 2017).\n\nReward processing was measured using the [specify task/scale], emotion processing was measured using the [specify task/scale], working memory was measured using the [specify task/scale], and impulsivity was measured using the [specify task/scale].\n\nThe integration of findings from the mass-univariate (GLM) and multivariate (LASSO) approaches provides complementary insights: GLM elucidates how threat or deprivation relates to each neurocognitive outcome individually, whereas LASSO highlights which combinations of variables best characterize ELS exposure. We focused on results that emerged consistently across both methods, enhancing the clarity and robustness of conclusions.",
