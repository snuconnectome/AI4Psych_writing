      "revised_text": "Covariates\n\nDemographics and Socioeconomic Status (SES)\n\nTo control for potential confounding variables, we included several demographic and socioeconomic covariates. Child's age at interview, gender (male/female), and race/ethnicity were recorded at baseline. Race/ethnicity was categorized as Hispanic, Black, White, Asian, or Other (including participants reporting multiple races). We included race/ethnicity because prior findings suggest structural inequalities may influence neurophysiological responses across racial/ethnic groups (Harnett et al., 2023). Parental education level, ranging from 0 (Never attended/Kindergarten only) to 21 (Doctoral degree), was defined as the highest degree received by either parent participating in the study. Household income was excluded as it was incorporated into the deprivation measure. The deprivation score was included in models analyzing the effect of threat to indirectly account for income effects.\n\nData Acquisition Site\n\nThe 21 ABCD study sites were included as a control variable. This accounts for site-related variability stemming from differences in scanner hardware and data collection protocols, reducing potential measurement bias.\n\nAdversity Exposure Before Birth\n\nAdversity exposure before birth was included as a covariate due to its potential influence on neurocognitive function. This included birth weight (continuous variable), premature birth (defined as gestational age < 37 weeks), cyanosis (blue at birth), and maternal smoking or alcohol consumption during pregnancy (assessed via self-report).\n\nParental Psychopathology and Substance Use\n\nParental psychopathology and substance use, often considered subcategories of Early Life Stress (ELS), were treated as covariates because it is difficult to clearly distinguish between threat and deprivation. Parental psychopathology was assessed at baseline using the Adult Self-Report (ASEBA; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2009). T-scores for DSM-5-oriented scales (anxiety, somatic problems, depressive symptoms, avoidant personality problems, attention deficit/hyperactivity problems [inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales], and antisocial personality problems) were included in the analyses. Only one parent (mother or father) completed the assessment; therefore, these psychopathology measures reflect data from a single parental source. Including these measures allows us to control for potential confounding effects of parental mental health on child neurocognitive development.\n\nParental Substance Use\n\nParental psychopathology and substance use, often considered subcategories of Early Life Stress (ELS), were treated as covariates because it is difficult to clearly distinguish between threat and deprivation. Parental substance use was assessed separately for mothers and fathers by determining whether they reported problems with alcohol or drug use. The specific questions used to assess substance use were: [Insert specific questions]. Maternal and paternal substance use were analyzed separately to capture potential distinct pathways. This is because maternal use more directly impacts daily caregiving if the mother is the primary caregiver, while paternal use influences the broader home environment or family stability. Furthermore, because data were collected separately for mothers and fathers, combining them into a single ‘parental use’ measure could conceal parent-specific differences and obscure potential differential effects on the child’s neurodevelopment. Analyzing maternal and paternal substance use separately allows us to account for these distinct pathways. \n\nChild Behavior Checklist (CBCL)\n\nThe parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2009) was used to assess the child's behavior over the past six months. The specific version of the CBCL used was the [specify version, e.g., CBCL/1.5-5 or CBCL/6-18]. T-scores for internalizing and externalizing problems were included as control variables due to their potential impact on neurocognitive functions. Baseline data were used for cross-sectional analyses, while 2-year follow-up data were utilized for longitudinal analyses. Using CBCL scores as covariates allows us to control for the potential impact of child behavior on neurocognitive outcomes.",
