Early life stress (ELS) encompasses adverse childhood experiences such as abuse, neglect, and household adversity. The impact of ELS on brain develop-ment, cognitive and affective functions, and mental health outcomes has been extensively investigated (Carr et al., 2013; Y. Chen & Baram, 2016; McLaughlin et al., 2019; Pechtel & Pizzagalli, 2011). Investigating its effects on neurocog-nitive functions is particularly critical for preventive interventions, as these functions represent key risk factors for psychiatric disorders.
Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for neurocognitive devel-opment, during which various systems interact and influence each other as they mature. Notably, the development of top-down and bottom-up processes progresses along distinct trajectories, and these patterns may be further in-fluenced by heightened emotional reactivity (Casey et al., 2008). To better understand these complex dynamics, it is crucial to consider how ELS influences both bottom-up processes (e.g., reward and emotion processing) and top-down processes (e.g., impulsivity and working memory) at the same time, as these systems are interdependent rather than isolated.
The Dimensional Model of Adversity and Psychopathology (DMAP; McLaugh-lin & Sheridan, 2016; Sheridan & McLaughlin, 2014) posits that threat and deprivation, the core dimensions of ELS, have distinct neural mechanisms. Threat involves experiences of actual or potential harm, whereas deprivation is characterized by the absence of critical developmental inputs from the envi-ronment (McLaughlin et al., 2014; Sheridan & McLaughlin, 2014). Behavioral
 
evidence suggests that threat is linked to negative emotion processing, while deprivation is associated with poor executive function (D. Johnson et al., 2021; Machlin et al., 2019; Schäfer et al., 2023). However, findings on brain function remain inconsistent. A systematic review noted non-significant or inconclusive results, despite the differing effects of threat, deprivation, and mixed exposure (McLaughlin et al., 2019).
This inconsistency may stem from small sample sizes and cross-sectional study designs with retrospective ELS measurement (McLaughlin et al., 2019). Small sample sizes, in particular, contribute to the replication crisis (Turner et al., 2018). To address this, recent studies have leveraged the large-scale longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to examine ELS and brain function (D. Beck et al., 2024; Jeong et al., 2024; Russell et al., 2025; Stinson et al., 2024; Vedechkina et al., 2024; A. Yang et al., 2024).
Nevertheless, many of these studies employed data-driven approaches (D. Beck et al., 2024; Jeong et al., 2024; Russell et al., 2025; Vedechkina et al., 2024) or relied on cumulative Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) scores (Stinson et al., 2024), complicating comparisons with earlier findings. One study applied the dimensional model, focusing on unpredictability and its relationship with resting-state functional connectivity and psychopathology (A. Yang et al., 2024). Task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is particularly well-suited for identifying neural correlates of cognitive processes (J. E. Chen & Glover, 2015) and holds promise for investigating the neural distinctions between threat and deprivation. To my knowledge, among studies utilizing large-scale data, only two have employed task-based fMRI: one examined network
 
efficiency using graph theory with data-driven ELS (Jeong et al., 2024), and the other explored impulsivity in relation to cumulative ELS (Stinson et al., 2024). However, these studies did not differentiate between threat and deprivation, limiting their applicability to dimensional frameworks.
Therefore, this study aims to investigate the distinct impacts of threat and deprivation on multiple neurocognitive functions during childhood, using task-based fMRI measures within a large-scale longitudinal dataset.
