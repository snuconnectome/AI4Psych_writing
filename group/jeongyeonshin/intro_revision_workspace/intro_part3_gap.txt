Introduction
Early life stress (ELS) encompasses adverse childhood experiences such as abuse, neglect, and household adversity. The impact of ELS on brain develop-ment, cognitive and affective functions, and mental health outcomes has been extensively investigated (Carr et al., 2013; Y. Chen & Baram, 2016; McLaughlin et al., 2019; Pechtel & Pizzagalli, 2011). Investigating its effects on neurocog-nitive functions is particularly critical for preventive interventions, as these functions represent key risk factors for psychiatric disorders.
Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for neurocognitive devel-opment, during which various systems interact and influence each other as they mature. Notably, the development of top-down and bottom-up processes progresses along distinct trajectories, and these patterns may be further in-fluenced by heightened emotional reactivity (Casey et al., 2008). To better understand these complex dynamics, it is crucial to consider how ELS influences both bottom-up processes (e.g., reward and emotion processing) and top-down processes (e.g., impulsivity and working memory) at the same time, as these systems are interdependent rather than isolated.
The Dimensional Model of Adversity and Psychopathology (DMAP; McLaugh-lin & Sheridan, 2016; Sheridan & McLaughlin, 2014) posits that threat and deprivation, the core dimensions of ELS, have distinct neural mechanisms. Threat involves experiences of actual or potential harm, whereas deprivation is characterized by the absence of critical developmental inputs from the envi-ronment (McLaughlin et al., 2014; Sheridan & McLaughlin, 2014). Behavioral
 
evidence suggests that threat is linked to negative emotion processing, while deprivation is associated with poor executive function (D. Johnson et al., 2021; Machlin et al., 2019; Schäfer et al., 2023). However, findings on brain function remain inconsistent. A systematic review noted non-significant or inconclusive results, despite the differing effects of threat, deprivation, and mixed exposure (McLaughlin et al., 2019).
This inconsistency may stem from small sample sizes and cross-sectional study designs with retrospective ELS measurement (McLaughlin et al., 2019). Small sample sizes, in particular, contribute to the replication crisis (Turner et al., 2018). To address this, recent studies have leveraged the large-scale longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to examine ELS and brain function (D. Beck et al., 2024; Jeong et al., 2024; Russell et al., 2025; Stinson et al., 2024; Vedechkina et al., 2024; A. Yang et al., 2024).
Nevertheless, many of these studies employed data-driven approaches (D. Beck et al., 2024; Jeong et al., 2024; Russell et al., 2025; Vedechkina et al., 2024) or relied on cumulative Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) scores (Stinson et al., 2024), complicating comparisons with earlier findings. One study applied the dimensional model, focusing on unpredictability and its relationship with resting-state functional connectivity and psychopathology (A. Yang et al., 2024). Task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is particularly well-suited for identifying neural correlates of cognitive processes (J. E. Chen & Glover, 2015) and holds promise for investigating the neural distinctions between threat and deprivation. To my knowledge, among studies utilizing large-scale data, only two have employed task-based fMRI: one examined network
 
efficiency using graph theory with data-driven ELS (Jeong et al., 2024), and the other explored impulsivity in relation to cumulative ELS (Stinson et al., 2024). However, these studies did not differentiate between threat and deprivation, limiting their applicability to dimensional frameworks.
Therefore, this study aims to investigate the distinct impacts of threat and deprivation on multiple neurocognitive functions during childhood, using task-based fMRI measures within a large-scale longitudinal dataset.
Early life stress and neurocognitive functions
The subsequent section will explore the impact of ELS on reward processing, emotion processing, working memory, and impulsivity, focusing on inconsistent findings in the field. Given the extensive research in this field, this discussion will primarily draw on evidence from task-based fMRI studies and behavioral outcomes. Notably, much of the existing research has assessed ELS without explicitly distinguishing between its specific dimensions, such as threat and deprivation. Such studies have been categorized as mixed exposure to facilitate comparison.

Reward processing

Reward processing encompasses the cognitive and neural mechanisms in-volved in recognizing, responding to, and learning from stimuli associated with rewards. Key brain regions implicated in the reward system include the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbital prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and ventral pallidum (Haber & Knutson, 2010). Altered reward processing is commonly
 
observed in psychiatric disorders such as depression (Baskin-Sommers & Foti, 2015; Forbes & Dahl, 2012; Pizzagalli et al., 2009) and Substance Use Disorder (SUD; Baskin-Sommers & Foti, 2015; A. Beck et al., 2009; Joyner et al., 2018). Evidence suggests that early life stress (ELS) disrupts ventral striatum-related functions, including reward responsiveness and approach motivation (Novick et al., 2018). A meta-analysis revealed medium associations between ELS and reward learning, with small associations in reward valuation and
responsiveness (Oltean et al., 2022).
Studies using the Behavioral Activation System (BAS; Carver & White, 1994), a self-reported measure of reward processing, have shown mixed findings. While most reported no significant relationships between ELS and BAS subscales (DelDonno et al., 2019; Dragan et al., 2019; S. L. Johnson et al., 2016; Marusak et al., 2015, 2017; Miu et al., 2017; Rosenman & Rodgers, 2009), some studies found reduced reward responsiveness (Babad et al., 2021; Dragan et al., 2019) and decreased drive, which reflects motivation for pursuing goals (Babad et al., 2021; Miu et al., 2017).
Behavioral assessments of the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task also yield diverse results. For threat, reaction time (RT) to reward-related stimuli varies, showing increases (Dillon et al., 2009), decreases (Dennison et al., 2016), or no significant differences (Mehta et al., 2010) compared to healthy controls. Similarly, for deprivation, RT has been reported to increase (Mueller et al., 2012) or show no significant differences (Mehta et al., 2010). Few studies have investigated accuracy, generally reporting no significant differences (Dennison et al., 2019; Mehta et al., 2010; Mueller et al., 2012), except for reduced performance
 
linked to food insecurity (Dennison et al., 2019).
Systematic reviews have demonstrated that reduced striatal activation during reward processing is related to ELS, particularly deprivation (Gerin et al., 2019; McCrory et al., 2017). Specifically, during reward anticipation, ELS is consistently associated with reduced activation in the ventral striatum (Boecker et al., 2014; Boecker-Schlier et al., 2016; Mehta et al., 2010), putamen, pallidum (Boecker-Schlier et al., 2016; Dillon et al., 2009) and anterior cingulate cortex (Boecker et al., 2014; Boecker-Schlier et al., 2016). In reward feedback, however, the results are less consistent. Most studies focus on mixed exposures, reporting heightened activation in the insula, pallidum, and putamen (Boecker et al., 2014; Boecker-Schlier et al., 2016), while others observe no differences (Birn et al., 2017; Mehta et al., 2010). Findings on ventral striatum activation during feedback show inconsistency (Boecker-Schlier et al., 2016; Hanson et al., 2015). (Please refer to Table 1 for further details of the results in reward processing.)

Emotion processing

Emotion processing involves the identification of emotional stimuli and the regulation of emotional responses. The amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), occipital cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are critical brain regions involved in this process (Phan et al., 2002). Studies on emotion regulation and ELS reveal atypical neural activation in regulatory areas such as the ventral ACC and inferior prefrontal cortex, with altered frontal-subcortical connectivity (McCrory et al., 2017). Threat is associated with fear learning (Machlin et al., 2019), biases toward angry faces (Schäfer et al., 2023), but not deprivation.
Task-based fMRI studies commonly reveal amygdala hyperactivation to negative emotional stimuli such as fear and anger in children exposed to threats (McCrory et al., 2011; McLaughlin et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2014). However, one study found reduced amygdala activation to angry faces and no significant difference to fearful faces (Hein et al., 2020). In cases of mixed ELS or deprivation, a systematic review revealed that the amygdala’s responses to negative emotional stimuli yield inconsistent results (McLaughlin et al., 2019). For deprivation, three studies reported amygdala hyperactivation to fearful faces (Gee et al., 2013; Maheu et al., 2010; Tottenham et al., 2011). However, studies have reported lower amygdala discrimination between parent and stranger faces (Callaghan et al., 2019; Olsavsky et al., 2013) and between trustworthy and untrustworthy faces (Green et al., 2016). For mixed exposure, most studies reported hyperactivation (Bellis & Hooper, 2012; Dannlowski et al., 2012, 2013; Harmelen et al., 2013;
 
McCrory et al., 2013), but some studies reported hypoactivation (Holz et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2006) or no significant findings (Fonzo et al., 2016).
Furthermore, behavioral measures on negative emotion processing show varied results. Reaction time (RT) to negative emotional stimuli is sometimes faster (Maheu et al., 2010; Tottenham et al., 2010), but often, no significant difference is observed compared to controls (Harmelen et al., 2013; McCrory et al., 2011; Metz et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2006; Tottenham et al., 2011). Accuracy in identifying negative emotional stimuli in children with ELS varies, being reported as higher (Metz et al., 2018), lower (McCrory et al., 2011; Tottenham et al., 2010), or equivalent to those without ELS (Dannlowski et al., 2012; Fonzo et al., 2016; McCrory et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2006).
In contrast to negative emotional stimuli, positive emotional stimuli remain underexplored, despite their importance as social rewards. Behavioral measures, such as accuracy and RT to positive stimuli, have mostly shown no significant differences between individuals with ELS and healthy controls (Goff et al., 2013; Maheu et al., 2010; Olsavsky et al., 2013).
In terms of neural activation, limited studies have found that threat is associated with hyperactivation in striatal regions, while deprivation is linked to deactivation in the ventral striatum. However, some studies have also reported no significant differences. Specifically, for threat, hyperactivation has been observed in striatal regions, including the nucleus accumbens and putamen (Dennison et al., 2016), as well as in the amygdala and pallidum (Suzuki et al., 2014). Conversely, other studies found no significant differences when participants viewed happy emotional stimuli (McLaughlin et al., 2015; Schweizer et al., 2016;
 
Suzuki et al., 2014).
For deprivation, studies reported no significant differences in response to happy emotional stimuli compared to healthy controls (Gee et al., 2013; Maheu et al., 2010). However, some findings have suggested deactivation in the ventral striatum in response to positive emotional stimuli (Goff et al., 2013; Hein et al., 2020). In cases of mixed ELS, one study reported hyperactivation in the amygdala, thalamus, and pallidum in response to positive emotional stimuli (McCrory et al., 2013). (Please refer to Table 2 for further details of the results in emotion processing.)

Working memory

Working memory is a critical component of cognitive processes and is impli-cated in a range of psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia (Lee & Park, 2005; Martinussen et al., 2005). A substantial body of research highlights the negative effects of ELS on working memory (Goodman et al., 2019). Successful working memory performance in-volves increased activity in the central executive network (CEN) and decreased activity in the default mode network (DMN) (Satterthwaite et al., 2013).
Most previous studies employing the N-Back task to assess working memory have utilized mixed ELS samples, yielding inconsistent neuroimaging findings. For example, one study reported greater DMN deactivation, particularly in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and inferior parietal lobe (IPL), in individuals with ELS compared to healthy controls (Philip et al., 2013). However, these findings were not replicated in a subsequent study with a slightly larger sample size (Philip et al., 2016), and one study reported increased left IPL activation in a non-clinical ELS group (Quidé et al., 2017). Notably, the IPL is also considered part of CEN, thus reduced IPL activation might reflect poorer working memory performance. Regarding other CEN regions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), one study reported reduced caudal MFG activation in mixed ELS samples (Hallowell et al., 2019), while another study found no significant results in the dlPFC (Metz et al., 2018).
Behavioral assessments typically reveal diminished working memory perfor-
 
mance in individuals with ELS (Danese et al., 2017; Fuge et al., 2014; Majer et al., 2010; Metz et al., 2018; Philip et al., 2016; Quidé et al., 2017; Viola et al., 2013). Nonetheless, some studies report no significant differences compared to healthy controls (Philip et al., 2013; Üçok et al., 2015). However, recent studies revealed that deprivation is more associated with poor working memory or executive function than threat (D. Johnson et al., 2021; Schäfer et al., 2023).
Findings regarding ELS and working memory remain inconsistent, with limited studies distinguishing the effects of threat and deprivation. Further research is needed to clarify how these distinct dimensions of ELS influence brain activation and performance. (Please refer to Table 3 for further details on the results of working memory.)

Impulsivity

Impulsivity has been proposed as a potential mechanism linking ELS and psychopathology, such as alcohol dependence (S. T. Kim et al., 2018; Liu, 2019). Previous studies on impulsivity and ELS have primarily utilized mixed ELS measures, making it difficult to separately review the effects of threat and deprivation. Impulsivity manifests in various dimensions: impulsive action (motor impulsivity), impulsive choice (cognitive impulsivity, including delay discounting), and impulsive personality traits (MacKillop et al., 2016). This section reviews the findings in terms of impulsivity dimensions.
In the context of impulsive actions (e.g., Stop Signal Task; SST), inconsistent findings have been reported. Some studies observed longer reaction time (RT), which are indicative of compromised inhibitory control in individuals with ELS (Lim et al., 2015; Merz et al., 2013; Mueller et al., 2010). However, others found no significant differences in RT or stop accuracy when comparing individuals with ELS to controls (Carrion et al., 2008; Elton et al., 2014; Hamilton et al., 2013; Hart & Rubia, 2012; Lim et al., 2015; Mezzacappa et al., 2001).
As for the neural correlates of impulsive action (e.g., during successful inhibition), research shows mixed results. Hyperactivation in inhibitory regions of the brain, such as the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and striatum, has been observed during successful inhibition (Mueller et al., 2010). In contrast, other studies have reported no significant neural differences (Elton et al., 2014; Liu, 2019), while some have found decreased activation in these regions (Bruce et al., 2013).
 
Regarding choice impulsivity, a majority of studies report an elevated dis-counting rate in individuals with ELS (Acheson et al., 2019; Oshri et al., 2018; Simmen-Janevska et al., 2015). However, one study found no significant cor-relation between discounting rate and the severity of ELS (Hamilton et al., 2013).
Trait impulsivity, as assessed through self-report measures, consistently appears elevated in individuals with ELS across studies (Hallowell et al., 2019; Liu, 2019; A. Yang et al., 2024). Among its subscales, negative urgency—defined as the tendency to act impulsively under distress—has been consistently reported as increased. Findings for other subscales, however, remain inconsistent (Gagnon et al., 2013; Liu, 2019; Shin et al., 2018; Weiss et al., 2023). (Please refer to Table 4 for further details on the results related to impulsivity.)
