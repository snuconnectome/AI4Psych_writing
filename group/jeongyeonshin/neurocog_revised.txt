Reward processing: Participants completed a modified Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task (Knutson et al., 2001; Casey et al., 2018) to assess reward processing. In each trial (n=100), participants were presented with one of five incentive cues (20 trials per cue type): win $5, win $0.20, lose $0.20, lose $5, or $0 (no win or loss). Following a variable delay ranging from 2 to 4 seconds, participants responded to a white square presented on a black background. The adaptive algorithm adjusted the target stimulus duration based on the participant's previous response accuracy to maintain accuracy at approximately 60% across all trial types (Casey et al., 2018). Cue types were presented in a randomized order for each participant. The MID task was presented using PsychoPy software on a Dell OptiPlex computer with a 24-inch monitor. We measured accuracy on reward trials and mean reaction time for successful reward trials. For fMRI analysis, two contrasts were specified: (1) 'reward versus neutral' activity at cue onset to index reward anticipation, and (2) 'positive feedback versus negative feedback' activity during reward trials to index reward feedback. Regions of interest (ROIs) included the rostral and caudal anterior cingulate cortex (rACC, cACC), insula, striatum (caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens [NAc]), and pallidum.

To complement the task-based assessment of reward processing using the MID task, we also assessed individual differences in reward sensitivity and motivation using the BIS/BAS scale. Participants completed a modified version of the ABCD BIS/BAS scale (Carver & White, 1994; PhenX toolkit) to quantify individual differences in reward sensitivity and goal-directed motivation. Participants rated the extent to which they agreed with each statement (e.g., "When I get something I want, I feel excited and energized") on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = very untrue, 3 = very true). Three BAS subscales were examined: Reward Responsiveness (positive reactions to rewards), Drive (motivation to pursue goals), and Fun Seeking (desire for new rewards).

Emotion processing was assessed using behavioral measures and fMRI beta weights from the Emotional N-Back (EN-back) task (Cohen et al., 2015; Figure ENBACK). Participants were recruited through university email lists and met the following inclusion criteria: age between 18 and 35, no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, and normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Exclusion criteria included current use of psychoactive medication. The sample consisted of 30 participants (M age = 22.3 years, SD = 2.1, 60% female). During the task, participants viewed blocks of happy, fearful, and neutral faces, as well as places, and were instructed to respond via button press (right button for a match, left button for a non-match) when the current stimulus matched a pre-designated target (0-back) or the stimulus presented two trials prior (2-back). Face stimuli were selected from the NimStim face stimulus set (Tottenham et al., 2009). A total of 10 different faces were used for each emotion category (happy, fearful, neutral). Each stimulus was presented for 500ms. Each participant completed two task runs, with each run consisting of four 2-back blocks and four 0-back blocks, presented in a pseudorandomized order. The pseudorandomized order ensured that no more than two consecutive blocks were of the same task condition (0-back or 2-back) or stimulus type (happy, fearful, neutral face, place). Each stimulus type (happy, fearful, neutral face, place) was presented in 40 trials per run, totaling 160 trials per run. The inter-trial interval (ITI) was jittered between 2 and 4 seconds.

Behavioral measures included accuracy for positive faces (positive accuracy), accuracy for negative faces (negative accuracy), average reaction time for correct responses to positive faces (positive RT), and average reaction time for correct responses to negative faces (negative RT). Accuracy was calculated as the proportion of correct responses for each condition. Reaction times exceeding 3 standard deviations from the mean for each participant were excluded from the analysis. For fMRI analysis, beta weights were derived from contrasts of 'positive face versus neutral face' and 'negative face versus neutral face'. Regions of interest (ROIs) included the rostral and caudal anterior cingulate cortex (rACC, cACC), insula, amygdala, striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens [NAc]), pallidum, and thalamic regions (thalamus, ventral diencephalon, and hippocampus). These ROIs were anatomically defined using the AAL atlas. The order of task runs and stimulus types was counterbalanced across participants. Stimulus difficulty was equated across stimulus types by ensuring similar luminance and contrast levels. Visual properties of the stimuli (e.g., luminance, contrast) were controlled for using the SHINE toolbox (Willenbockel et al., 2010).

Working Memory Task: We assessed working memory using an N-Back task (Cohen et al., 2015; see Figure X for a schematic). Participants viewed a series of single digits (1-9) presented in white font (size 24) on a black background. Each stimulus was presented for 500 ms, followed by an ISI of 2500 ms. Participants responded by pressing the 'yes' or 'no' buttons on a response box, indicating whether the current stimulus matched the one presented 'N' trials prior (where N represents the number of trials back). The order of the 0-back and 2-back conditions was counterbalanced across participants. Participants completed a practice block of 10 trials before beginning the experimental task. Each participant completed 100 trials in each condition (0-back and 2-back). In the 2-back condition, participants indicated whether the current stimulus matched the stimulus presented two trials previously, requiring greater working memory capacity compared to the 0-back condition, where participants indicated whether the current stimulus matched a pre-defined target. For fMRI analyses, we contrasted the 2-back and 0-back conditions to isolate neural activity related to working memory load.

Regions of Interest (ROIs): We defined ROIs anatomically using the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) based on the known involvement of the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Central Executive Network (CEN). DMN ROIs included the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; specifically, rostral anterior cingulate cortex [rACC] and medial orbitofrontal cortex [mOFC]), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). CEN ROIs included dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Specifically, dlPFC included rostral and caudal middle frontal gyrus [rMFG, cMFG], and PPC included superior and inferior parietal lobule [SPL, IPL]. We extracted beta values from these ROIs for subsequent analyses. In addition to fMRI measures, we also examined behavioral measures of working memory performance.

Behavioral Measures: We used accuracy (percentage of correct responses) and average reaction time (in milliseconds) from the 2-back trials as behavioral measures of working memory performance. These measures provided insight into the efficiency of working memory processes.

NIH Toolbox Working Memory Measures: We also included the List Sorting Working Memory Test and the Dimensional Change Card Sort Test from the NIH Toolbox (Tulsky et al., 2013) as additional behavioral measures of working memory. In the List Sorting Test, participants were asked to recall and sequence visually presented items (numbers and letters) in ascending order. In the Dimensional Change Card Sort Test, participants sorted cards based on either color or shape, with the sorting rule switching periodically. We used age-corrected scores for both tasks. Note that these tasks were only administered at baseline and therefore were limited to cross-sectional analyses.

Impulsivity was assessed using the Stop Signal Task (SST) for impulsive action, the modified UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale for Children for trait impulsivity, and the Cash Choice Task for impulsive choice.

**Stop Signal Task (SST):** Impulsive action was assessed using a modified version of the Stop Signal Task (SST; Logan et al., 1984; adapted by Casey et al., 2018). Participants responded to a left or right arrow by pressing the 'D' key for left arrows and the 'K' key for right arrows on a standard QWERTY keyboard as quickly and accurately as possible during "Go" trials. Each arrow stimulus was presented for 500ms, followed by a 1000ms ISI. The ITI was 2000ms. On 16.67% of trials, an unpredictable "Stop signal" (up-right arrow) appeared, requiring participants to inhibit their response. Trial types (Go and Stop) were presented in a randomized order for each participant. Participants completed 10 practice trials before the start of the main SST to familiarize themselves with the task. Each participant completed two runs of 180 trials each (360 trials total). To maintain approximately 50% accuracy on Stop trials, the stop signal delay (SSD) was dynamically adjusted using a staircase procedure (Casey et al., 2018). The initial SSD was 250ms, and the SSD was adjusted by 50ms increments. For fMRI analysis, the "correct stop versus correct go" contrast examined successful inhibition. Regions of interest (ROIs) included the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; pars triangularis and pars orbitalis), rostral and caudal anterior cingulate cortex (rACC, cACC), and the striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens [NAc]). The Stop Signal Task and Cash Choice Task were programmed and presented using PsychoPy (Version 3.0; Peirce et al., 2019). Responses were collected using a standard QWERTY keyboard. This task allowed for the assessment of impulsive action.

**UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale:** Trait impulsivity was measured using the modified Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, and Positive Urgency Impulsive Behavior Scale for Children (UPPS-P; Barch et al., 2018). This 20-item questionnaire, designed for youth, assesses five subscales: lack of planning, lack of perseverance, sensation seeking, positive urgency, and negative urgency. Participants rated each item on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all like me) to 4 (very much like me). Subscale scores were calculated by averaging the ratings for the items within each subscale. This scale allowed for the assessment of trait impulsivity.

**Cash Choice Task:** Impulsive choice was assessed using the Cash Choice Task (Luciana et al., 2018), included only in cross-sectional analyses. Participants were presented with a single forced-choice question: “Let’s pretend a kind person wanted to give you some money. Would you rather have $75 in 3 days or $115 in 6 months?” Choosing the smaller, immediate reward ($75) was interpreted as reflecting greater impulsivity, while selecting the larger, delayed reward ($115) indicated lower impulsivity. This task allowed for the assessment of impulsive choice.
