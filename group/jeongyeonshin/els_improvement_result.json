      "revised_text": "Deprivation measures included emotional neglect, physical neglect, parental separation, previous institutionalization, food insecurity, utility insecurity, household poverty, and neighborhood poverty. We operationalized each measure as follows:\n\nEmotional neglect was assessed using ten items from the ABCD Children’s Report of Parental Behavioral Inventory (example item: \"First caregiver makes me feel better after talking over my worries with him/her\"). The items used to assess emotional neglect were: [list all 10 items]. Participants responded to each item on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'Strongly Disagree' to 'Strongly Agree'. Physical neglect was measured using five items related to parental monitoring from ABCD Parental Monitoring Survey (example item: \"In an average week, how many times do you and your parents/guardians eat dinner together?\"). The items used to assess physical neglect were: [list all 5 items]. Although we did not report responses for both neglect scales, we used them to create a dichotomous variable: a participant was coded as experiencing neglect if they endorsed at least one item.\n\nParental separation was defined as parents reporting being \"separated\" or \"divorced,\" or if the current partner was not the child’s biological or adoptive parent. Previous institutionalization was identified if the parent answered \"yes\" to the question: \"Is your partner the child's adoptive parent?\"\n\nFood insecurity was assessed with the item: \"In the past 12 months, has there been a time when you and your immediate family experienced any of the following: Needed food but couldn't afford to buy it or couldn't afford to go out to get it?\" Utility insecurity was measured using six items about the affordability of housing or essential services, such as telephone or medical care, in the past year. The items used to assess utility insecurity were: [list all 6 items]. Although we did not report responses for all insecurity items, we used them to create a dichotomous variable: a participant was coded as experiencing insecurity if they endorsed at least one item.\n\nNeighborhood poverty was assessed using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI; Kind & Kinney, 2014), with higher national percentiles indicating greater deprivation. We used the 2014 version of the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). A national percentile of 85 or higher was classified as neighborhood poverty (Kind & Kinney, 2014). We derived household poverty using the income-to-needs ratio (INR), as described in a previous study (Kim et al., 2022). Since income was reported in the following ranges: [$0-9,999], [$10,000-19,999], [$20,000-29,999], [$30,000-39,999], [$40,000-49,999], [$50,000+], the median value of each range was used for calculations. We calculated the INR by dividing household income by the poverty line based on family size provided by the 2017 Poverty Guidelines (HHS Poverty Guidelines, 2017), obtained from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines). An INR below 1 was defined as household poverty (Kim et al., 2022).\n\nTo calculate scores for the deprivation dimension, the presence of each measure was coded as a dichotomous variable (present if at least one item within a measure was marked). We created a deprivation score by summing the dichotomous variables. Participants with missing data on any of the deprivation measures were excluded from the analysis. The deprivation score ranged from 0 to 8. Participants scoring within the top 10% were assigned to the high-deprivation group (deprivation scores of 3 or higher; ≥90th percentile). The top 10% threshold was determined based on the distribution of deprivation scores in the entire sample.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our findings, we tested alternative thresholds for group classification. For threat, the top 20% cut-off included nearly half of the sample (up to the 50th percentile), making it unsuitable for meaningful group distinctions. Similarly, the top 5% cut-off produced the same group classifications as the 10% threshold, limiting its utility.",
