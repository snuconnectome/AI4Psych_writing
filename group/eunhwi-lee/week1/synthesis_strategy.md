# Synthesis Strategy for Systematic Review Introduction

**Review Topic**: NIBS interventions for addiction that examine neurocognitive mechanisms

**Source Materials**: Q1 (Addiction + RLDM) and Q2 (Addiction + NIBS)

---

## 1. Overlapping Concepts (공통 개념)

### Addiction as a Disorder of Decision-Making
- **Q1 perspective**: Addiction as maladaptive decision-making driven by aberrant RLDM processes
- **Q2 perspective**: Addiction involves impaired decision-making, cognitive control, and cue reactivity
- **Integration**: Both frame addiction through neurocognitive lens, not just symptom-based

### Brain Circuits
- **Common regions**: dlPFC, ACC, striatum (NAc), dopaminergic pathways
- **Q1 focus**: VTA/SN → striatum → PFC circuits as substrates for RL computations
- **Q2 focus**: dlPFC and ACC as primary NIBS targets for addiction intervention
- **Integration**: Q2 targets the same circuits Q1 identifies as critical for RLDM processes

### Theoretical Framework
- Both emphasize need for mechanistic understanding beyond symptom-level outcomes
- Both recognize dopamine's central role in addiction pathophysiology

## 2. Complementary Perspectives (보완 개념)

### Q1 Provides: Computational Mechanisms
- **Frameworks**: RL, RLDM, temporal difference learning
- **Key parameters**: Learning rate, discount factor, model-free vs model-based learning
- **Neural signatures**: RPE signaling, value encoding, prediction errors
- **Contribution**: Provides theoretical framework for WHAT mechanisms are altered in addiction

### Q2 Provides: Intervention Techniques
- **Techniques**: TMS (single-pulse, rTMS, iTBS, cTBS), tDCS (anodal, cathodal)
- **Target regions**: dlPFC, mPFC, ACC, with specific stimulation protocols
- **Clinical outcomes**: Craving reduction, cognitive control enhancement
- **Contribution**: Provides practical approach for HOW to modulate these circuits

### Key Complementarity
- Q1 answers: "What computational parameters are altered in addiction?"
- Q2 answers: "What brain regions can we stimulate to intervene?"
- **Missing link**: "What happens to computational parameters when we apply NIBS?"

## 3. Bridging Concepts (브릿지 개념)

### Computational Targets for NIBS
- **Bridge 1**: dlPFC stimulation → affects model-based decision-making and cognitive control
  - Q1: dlPFC critical for model-based learning and executive function
  - Q2: dlPFC is primary TMS target for addiction
  - Link: NIBS to dlPFC may enhance model-based control over model-free habitual responses

- **Bridge 2**: Striatal modulation → changes learning rate and reward valuation
  - Q1: Striatum encodes RPE and value signals
  - Q2: Deep TMS can reach striatal regions
  - Link: NIBS effects on striatum may alter learning from rewards/punishments

- **Bridge 3**: ACC targeting → modifies conflict monitoring and decision thresholds
  - Q1: ACC involved in prediction error processing and conflict detection
  - Q2: ACC is secondary NIBS target
  - Link: NIBS to ACC may affect decision thresholds in computational models (e.g., DDM)

### Mechanism-Informed Intervention
- Q1 identifies which computational parameters are disrupted (learning rate, discount factor, model-based/free balance)
- Q2 provides tools to modulate circuits that implement these computations
- **Bridge**: Studies measuring computational outcomes after NIBS can test causal relationships

## 4. Systematic Review Gap

### Individual Paper Gaps

**Q1 Gap**:
- Focuses on understanding mechanisms but mostly in basic research context
- Does not extensively cover intervention approaches
- Lacks discussion of how to translate computational understanding to treatment

**Q2 Gap (explicitly stated)**:
- "Cognitive and neural pathways underlying these effects are often unclear"
- "Recent studies have begun incorporating cognitive tasks into NIBS protocols to probe changes in decision-making, learning, and affect regulation"
- When NIBS reduces substance use, unclear if it's through:
  - Enhanced cognitive control?
  - Improved value-based decision-making?
  - Altered cue responses?
  - Changes in learning parameters?

### Systematic Review Gap (at the intersection)

**What's missing**:
A systematic synthesis of studies that combine NIBS interventions with neurocognitive/computational assessments in addiction populations.

**Specific knowledge gaps**:
1. **Which neurocognitive mechanisms have been examined** when applying NIBS to addiction?
   - What cognitive tasks are used? (decision-making, inhibitory control, reward processing?)
   - What computational models are applied? (RL models, DDM, other?)

2. **What evidence exists for NIBS effects** on specific neurocognitive parameters?
   - Does NIBS change learning rates? Discount factors? Model-based/free balance?
   - Does NIBS improve inhibitory control or decision thresholds?
   - Are there specific cognitive domains more responsive to NIBS?

3. **How do methodological approaches vary**?
   - Which NIBS protocols (TMS type, tDCS polarity, parameters) are used with which tasks?
   - What target regions are associated with which cognitive outcome measures?
   - What is the quality of mechanistic assessment?

4. **What patterns emerge** from this intersection?
   - Consistent findings vs null results
   - Moderators (substance type, addiction severity, stimulation parameters)
   - Theoretical coherence with computational psychiatry framework

**Why this review matters**:
- Moves beyond symptom-level outcomes to mechanistic understanding
- Bridges basic computational neuroscience with clinical intervention
- Identifies which computational parameters are modifiable targets
- Informs future mechanism-informed, precision NIBS interventions

## 5. Introduction Structure (Funnel Approach)

### BROAD (Para 1-2)
- Addiction as major public health challenge with limited treatment efficacy
- Need for novel interventions informed by mechanistic understanding
- Two major advances: (1) computational psychiatry understanding of addiction, (2) neuromodulation techniques

### NARROWING (Para 3-5)
- **Para 3**: Computational models (RLDM) reveal specific neurocognitive parameters altered in addiction
  - Use Q1 concepts: RL framework, RPE, model-free/model-based, neural circuits
  - Key point: Addiction involves disrupted learning, valuation, and decision-making at computational level

- **Para 4**: NIBS as promising intervention targeting these circuits
  - Use Q2 concepts: TMS/tDCS techniques, dlPFC/ACC targets, emerging clinical evidence
  - Key point: NIBS can modulate activity in circuits implementing these computations

- **Para 5**: Recent emergence of studies combining NIBS with cognitive/computational assessments
  - Cite Q2's observation: "recent studies have begun incorporating cognitive tasks"
  - Key point: Shift from symptom-only to mechanism-focused evaluation

### GAP (Para 6)
- **Problem**: Literature not systematically reviewed
- **Consequence**: Unclear which mechanisms are affected, which protocols work for which cognitive domains, how to optimize NIBS for specific computational targets
- **Need**: Systematic synthesis to bridge computational understanding and intervention practice

### SCOPE (Para 7)
- **This review's goal**: Systematically identify and synthesize studies combining NIBS with neurocognitive/computational assessments in addiction
- **Specific aims**:
  1. Identify all relevant studies (inclusion criteria: NIBS + cognitive task/computational modeling + addiction)
  2. Synthesize findings on NIBS effects on neurocognitive mechanisms
  3. Evaluate methodological approaches and quality
  4. Identify gaps and propose future directions for mechanism-informed interventions
- **Structure preview**: Methods → Results (organized by cognitive domain and NIBS technique) → Discussion

## 6. Key Terminology Decisions

### Unified Terms
- **NIBS (Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation)**: Umbrella term for TMS and tDCS
- **RLDM (Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making)**: Framework from Q1
- **Neurocognitive mechanisms**: Cognitive processes with neural implementation (broader than "computational")
- **Computational modeling**: Formal mathematical models (RL, DDM, etc.)
- **Mechanistic assessment**: Evaluation beyond symptom/behavioral level

### Terms to Bridge
- Q1 uses "RLDM processes" ↔ Q2 uses "cognitive control" and "decision-making"
  - **Solution**: Use "neurocognitive mechanisms" as broader term, specify computational models when relevant

- Q1 focuses on "dopamine as RPE signal" ↔ Q2 focuses on "circuit modulation"
  - **Solution**: Connect through "circuits implementing RL computations"

## 7. Citation Strategy

### Concepts from Q1 (to cite in Para 3)
- RL/RLDM framework in addiction [cite Q1 + original sources]
- Dopamine as RPE signal [cite foundational papers]
- Model-free/model-based learning disruptions [cite Q1 + key studies]
- Neural circuits: VTA/SN → striatum → PFC [cite systems neuroscience papers]

## 8. Integration Notes

### Key Integration Points

1. **Circuits as computational substrates**
   - Q1 describes circuits as implementing RL computations
   - Q2 targets these same circuits with NIBS
   - Integration: "NIBS can modulate circuits that implement computational processes identified in Q1"

2. **From understanding to intervention**
   - Q1 provides mechanistic understanding (what's disrupted)
   - Q2 provides intervention tools (how to modulate)
   - Integration: "Computational understanding informs which parameters to target; NIBS provides tools to test causal relationships"

3. **Mechanism-informed precision medicine**
   - Computational models identify individual-level parameter disruptions
   - NIBS protocols could be tailored to individual computational profiles
   - Integration: Future direction for personalized interventions

### What Makes This a Novel Synthesis

**Not just**:
- Summary of computational models + summary of NIBS interventions

**But rather**:
- Systematic review of the **intersection**: studies that empirically test NIBS effects on computational/neurocognitive parameters
- Evaluation of **mechanistic evidence**: does NIBS change what computational models predict it should?
- Framework for **mechanism-informed interventions**: using computational profiles to guide NIBS targeting
