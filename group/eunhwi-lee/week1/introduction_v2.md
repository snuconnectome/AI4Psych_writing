## Integrating Computational Neuroscience and Neuromodulation Approaches to Addiction: A Systematic Review of NIBS Interventions that Examine Neurocognitive Mechanisms

---

## INTRODUCTION

### Paragraph 1: Broad Context

Substance use disorders represent a major public health challenge, affecting millions worldwide and contributing substantially to global disease burden. Despite decades of research and treatment development, relapse rates remain high, and available interventions show limited long-term efficacy. This persistent challenge has motivated researchers to seek novel therapeutic approaches informed by a deeper mechanistic understanding of addiction neurobiology. Two major scientific advances in recent years promise to improve addiction treatment: first, computational psychiatry has revealed the specific neurocognitive parameters disrupted in addiction; second, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques can modulate neural circuits implicated in addictive behaviors.

### Paragraph 2: Computational Models Reveal Mechanisms

Computational models, particularly those based on reinforcement learning and decision-making (RLDM), have transformed our understanding of addiction from a symptom-based disorder to a disorder of specific neurocognitive computations. Within this framework, dopamine functions as a reward prediction error (RPE) signal that drives learning about the value of drug-related stimuli and actions. Addiction emerges through aberrant learning: heightened learning from drug rewards, altered discount rates favoring immediate gratification, and an imbalance between model-free (habitual) and model-based (goal-directed) decision-making systems. Identifiable neural circuits show these computational disruptions—the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra project dopamine signals to the striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC), where neurons encode values and make decisions. Critically, computational models quantify individual-level deficits through specific parameters—learning rates, discount factors, model-based/model-free balance—that could serve as intervention targets.

### Paragraph 3: NIBS as Intervention Tool

Paralleling advances in computational understanding, NIBS techniques promise to modulate the brain circuits that implement these computational processes. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can non-invasively alter neural excitability and connectivity in cortical regions; newer techniques like deep TMS reach subcortical structures. In addiction, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been the primary stimulation target for its role in cognitive control and executive function, while the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial PFC (mPFC) represent secondary targets involved in conflict monitoring and value-based decision-making. Clinical trials show that NIBS to these regions can reduce craving and, in some cases, decrease substance use. Notably, NIBS targets the same circuits that implement disrupted RLDM processes: dlPFC for model-based control, ACC for conflict detection, and striatum for value learning.

### Paragraph 4: Emergence of Mechanism-Focused Studies

This understanding has recently shifted NIBS research for addiction: studies now incorporate cognitive tasks and computational modeling alongside clinical outcome measures to probe the neurocognitive mechanisms through which NIBS exerts its effects. Rather than assessing only whether NIBS reduces craving or substance use, researchers now ask how NIBS affects decision-making, learning from rewards and punishments, inhibitory control, and value-based choice. Some studies employ formal computational models to quantify NIBS effects on specific parameters—does dlPFC stimulation enhance model-based relative to model-free learning? Does striatal modulation alter learning rates for drug versus non-drug rewards? Does ACC targeting change decision thresholds in conflict situations? This mechanistic approach converges computational neuroscience and clinical intervention research, moving the field toward mechanism-informed, precision neuromodulation.

### Paragraph 5: Gap Statement

However, despite the theoretical alignment between computational understanding and NIBS intervention—and despite the emergence of studies combining both—this literature has not been systematically reviewed. Without such a synthesis, several critical knowledge gaps remain. First, it remains unclear which neurocognitive mechanisms have been empirically examined when NIBS is applied to addiction populations, and what cognitive tasks or computational models have been employed. Second, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the evidence for NIBS effects on specific neurocognitive parameters: does NIBS reliably change learning rates, discount factors, or the balance between decision-making systems? Third, studies vary in NIBS protocols, target regions, cognitive assessments, and addiction populations, but this methodological heterogeneity has not been systematically evaluated to identify which approaches yield the most robust mechanistic insights. Finally, without such a synthesis, we cannot assess whether empirical findings cohere with predictions from computational theories or identify where theoretical frameworks need refinement.

### Paragraph 6: Review Aims and Scope

This systematic review addresses these gaps by identifying and synthesizing all studies that combine NIBS interventions with neurocognitive or computational assessments in addiction populations. We have four aims: (1) identify all relevant studies meeting inclusion criteria—NIBS application in substance use disorders with assessment of neurocognitive mechanisms via cognitive tasks or computational modeling; (2) synthesize findings on which neurocognitive mechanisms are affected by NIBS, including effects on cognitive domains (e.g., inhibitory control, reward learning, value-based decision-making) and computational parameters (e.g., learning rates, discount factors, model-based/model-free balance); (3) evaluate methodological approaches, including NIBS protocols, target brain regions, cognitive assessment tools, computational models employed, and quality of mechanistic assessment; and (4) identify current gaps and propose future directions for mechanism-informed NIBS interventions. By reviewing the intersection of computational neuroscience understanding and neuromodulation practice, this review aims to develop precision, mechanistically targeted treatments for addiction.
