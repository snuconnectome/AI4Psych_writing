## Integrating Computational Neuroscience and Neuromodulation Approaches to Addiction: A Systematic Review of NIBS Interventions that Examine Neurocognitive Mechanisms

---

## DRAFT INTRODUCTION

### Paragraph 1: Broad Context - Addiction as Major Challenge

Substance use disorders represent a major public health challenge, affecting millions worldwide and contributing substantially to global disease burden. Despite decades of research and treatment development, relapse rates remain high, and available interventions show limited long-term efficacy. This persistent challenge has motivated researchers to seek novel therapeutic approaches informed by a deeper mechanistic understanding of addiction neurobiology. Two major scientific advances have emerged in recent years that hold promise for improving addiction treatment: first, computational psychiatry has revealed the specific neurocognitive parameters disrupted in addiction; second, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have demonstrated the ability to modulate neural circuits implicated in addictive behaviors.

### Paragraph 2: Narrowing - Computational Models Reveal Mechanisms

Computational models, particularly those based on reinforcement learning and decision-making (RLDM), have transformed our understanding of addiction from a symptom-based disorder to a disorder of specific neurocognitive computations. Within this framework, dopamine functions as a reward prediction error (RPE) signal that drives learning about the value of drug-related stimuli and actions. Addiction emerges through aberrant learning processes: heightened learning from drug rewards, altered discount rates favoring immediate gratification, and an imbalance between model-free (habitual) and model-based (goal-directed) decision-making systems. These computational disruptions are implemented in identifiable neural circuits—the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra project dopamine signals to the striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC), where value representations and decision processes are encoded. Critically, computational models provide not just descriptive accounts but quantifiable parameters—learning rates, discount factors, model-based/model-free balance—that characterize individual-level deficits and could serve as intervention targets.

### Paragraph 3: Narrowing - NIBS as Intervention Tool

Paralleling advances in computational understanding, NIBS techniques have emerged as promising tools for modulating the brain circuits that implement these computational processes. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can non-invasively alter neural excitability and connectivity in cortical regions, with newer techniques like deep TMS extending reach to subcortical structures. In addiction, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been the primary stimulation target due to its role in cognitive control and executive function, while the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial PFC (mPFC) represent secondary targets involved in conflict monitoring and value-based decision-making. Clinical trials have demonstrated that NIBS to these regions can reduce craving and, in some cases, decrease substance use. Notably, the brain regions targeted by NIBS—dlPFC for model-based control, ACC for conflict detection, striatum for value learning—are the same circuits that computational models identify as implementing RLDM processes disrupted in addiction.

### Paragraph 4: Narrowing - Emergence of Mechanism-Focused Studies

Recent years have witnessed a critical shift in NIBS research for addiction: studies have begun incorporating cognitive tasks and computational modeling alongside clinical outcome measures to probe the neurocognitive mechanisms through which NIBS exerts its effects. Rather than assessing only whether NIBS reduces craving or substance use, researchers now ask how NIBS affects decision-making, learning from rewards and punishments, inhibitory control, and value-based choice. Some studies employ formal computational models to quantify NIBS effects on specific parameters—does dlPFC stimulation enhance model-based relative to model-free learning? Does striatal modulation alter learning rates for drug versus non-drug rewards? Does ACC targeting change decision thresholds in conflict situations? This mechanistic approach represents a convergence of computational neuroscience and clinical intervention research, moving the field toward mechanism-informed, precision neuromodulation.

### Paragraph 5: Gap Statement

However, despite the theoretical alignment between computational understanding and NIBS intervention—and despite the emergence of studies combining both—this literature has not been systematically reviewed. The absence of such a synthesis creates several critical knowledge gaps. First, it remains unclear which neurocognitive mechanisms have been empirically examined when NIBS is applied to addiction populations, and what cognitive tasks or computational models have been employed. Second, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the evidence for NIBS effects on specific neurocognitive parameters: does NIBS reliably change learning rates, discount factors, or the balance between decision-making systems? Third, methodological heterogeneity across studies—varying NIBS protocols, target regions, cognitive assessments, and addiction populations—has not been systematically evaluated to identify which approaches yield the most robust mechanistic insights. Finally, without such a synthesis, we cannot assess whether empirical findings cohere with predictions from computational theories or identify where theoretical frameworks need refinement.

### Paragraph 6: Review Aims and Scope

This systematic review addresses these gaps by identifying and synthesizing all studies that combine NIBS interventions with neurocognitive or computational assessments in addiction populations. Our specific aims are fourfold: (1) identify all relevant studies meeting inclusion criteria—NIBS application in substance use disorders with assessment of neurocognitive mechanisms via cognitive tasks or computational modeling; (2) synthesize findings on which neurocognitive mechanisms are affected by NIBS, including effects on cognitive domains (e.g., inhibitory control, reward learning, value-based decision-making) and computational parameters (e.g., learning rates, discount factors, model-based/model-free balance); (3) evaluate methodological approaches, including NIBS protocols, target brain regions, cognitive assessment tools, computational models employed, and quality of mechanistic assessment; and (4) identify current gaps and propose future directions for mechanism-informed NIBS interventions. By systematically reviewing the intersection of computational neuroscience understanding and neuromodulation practice, this review aims to advance the development of precision, mechanistically targeted treatments for addiction.

### Coherence Assessment

**Funnel Structure: ✓ Strong**
- Clear progression from broad (addiction challenge + two advances) to narrow (mechanism-focused NIBS studies) to gap (no systematic synthesis) to scope (this review's aims)
- Each paragraph builds logically on the previous

**Narrative Flow: ✓ Good**
- Para 1→2: From "computational psychiatry reveals mechanisms" to detailed explanation of computational mechanisms
- Para 2→3: From "circuits implementing computations" to "NIBS modulates those circuits"
- Para 3→4: From "NIBS targets these circuits clinically" to "emerging studies assess mechanisms"
- Para 4→5: From "studies emerging" to "but not systematically reviewed"
- Para 5→6: From "gaps in knowledge" to "this review's aims"

**Conceptual Integration: ✓ Strong**
- Q1 and Q2 are not just juxtaposed but explicitly connected through shared circuits and mechanisms
- Integration is bidirectional: computational models inform NIBS targets, NIBS studies test computational predictions
- Systematic review positioned as addressing gap at the intersection, not summarizing two separate literatures

**Potential Improvements:**
- Para 2 is dense with technical concepts—may need simplification or breaking into two paragraphs
- Para 4 makes strong claims about "studies employing computational models"—need to verify specific examples exist
- May need transition sentence between Para 4 and 5 to smooth the shift from "emergence" to "gap"

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Verify claims in Para 4**: Search for specific studies that combined NIBS + computational modeling in addiction
   - If few exist, adjust language to be more cautious
   - If many exist, this strengthens the case for systematic review

2. **Run `/citation-help`** (or equivalent) to identify all citation needs systematically

3. **Run `/writing-review`** (or equivalent) for precision writing improvements:
   - Check for nominalizations (e.g., "computational disruptions are implemented" → consider revising)
   - Verify subject-verb clarity
   - Check coherence and transitions
   - Aim for ~20% reduction through concision

4. **Add missing literature:**
   - Foundational computational papers
   - NIBS methods and meta-analyses
   - Specific mechanistic studies as examples
   - Prior reviews for contrast

5. **Final polish:**
   - Verify terminology consistency
   - Strengthen transitions if needed
   - Ensure gap statement is compelling and specific
   - Check that scope is clear and feasible
