# Prompts Used for Week 1 Assignment

## 1. Initial Request
안뇽.. 내가 최근 .claude에 writing agent를 빌드했는데 그걸 기반으로 리뷰 페이퍼 인트로 파트를 작성하고 싶어

내가 제일 먼저 해보고 싶은 건 /review-paper 폴더에 있는 pdf 두 개 내용을 기반으로 내가 새로 작성하려고 하는 리뷰페이퍼의 intro 파트 초안을 작성하는거야. 새로 쓰는 리뷰의 주제는 addiction + NIBS + neurocognitive/computational(RLDM) mechanism 이야. pdf 두 개는 각각 addiction + RLDM, addiction + TMS/tDCS 에 대해 내가 작성한 퀄 페이퍼야. 어떤 식으로 에이전트를 활용할 수 있을까? 필요하다면 추가적으로 에이전트를 생성해줘. 너가 직접 pdf 를 읽으면 자꾸 오류가 나니까 (파일 용량이 커서), 워크플로우를 짜서 내가 실행해볼 수 있도록 해줘.

## 2. Scope Clarification
ㅇㅇ 좋아. 참고로 나는 addiction에서 NIBS를 적용하면서 그 neurocognitive mechanism에 대해 함께 살펴본 (가령, cognitive task나 computational modeling을 사용한) 선행연구들에 대한 systematic review를 진행하는 게 목적이야. 이걸 참고해서 워크플로우나 프롬프트 수정이 필요하면 해주고, 네가 짠 워크플로우대로 일을 진행시켜줘.

## 3. PDF Extraction with Task/Explore Agent

For PhD_Qual_Q1_final.pdf:
```
I need to extract key concepts from the Introduction section of this PDF about addiction and RLDM.

Focus on:
1. Main theoretical frameworks (RLDM, reinforcement learning)
2. Neural circuits and mechanisms (dopamine, reward prediction error)
3. Key findings about addiction as a decision-making disorder
4. Gaps identified in the literature

Please read only the Introduction section and extract these concepts in a structured format.
```

For PhD_Qual_Q2_final.pdf:
```
I need to extract key concepts from the Introduction section of this PDF about addiction and NIBS (TMS/tDCS).

Focus on:
1. NIBS techniques and parameters (TMS types, tDCS protocols)
2. Target brain regions (dlPFC, ACC, mPFC)
3. Clinical outcomes and mechanisms
4. ANY mentions of cognitive tasks or computational modeling used with NIBS
5. Gaps identified in the literature

Please read only the Introduction section and extract these concepts in a structured format.
```

## 4. Synthesis Strategy Development

No explicit prompt - agent autonomously created synthesis-strategy.md based on extracted concepts from Q1 and Q2, identifying:
- Overlapping concepts (shared brain circuits, decision-making framework)
- Complementary perspectives (Q1=mechanisms, Q2=interventions)
- Bridging concepts (NIBS targets circuits implementing RLDM)
- Systematic review gap (no synthesis of NIBS + neurocognitive mechanism studies)
- Introduction structure using funnel approach

## 5. Introduction Draft Generation (synthesize-intro approach)

Provided to agent:
- Extracted concepts from Q1 (RLDM mechanisms)
- Extracted concepts from Q2 (NIBS interventions)
- Synthesis strategy document
- Review aims and scope:
  * Systematic review of NIBS + neurocognitive/computational assessment in addiction
  * NOT just synthesizing two topics separately
  * Focus on INTERSECTION: studies combining NIBS with cognitive tasks OR computational modeling
  * Inclusion criteria: NIBS + cognitive assessment + addiction populations

Agent generated intro-v1.md (6 paragraphs, funnel structure, ~1150 words)

## 6. Writing Review with /writing-review

Slash command executed: /writing-review

Agent analyzed intro-v1.md using Duke precision writing principles:
- Subjects and Actions (nominalizations → verbs)
- Cohesion and Coherence (old info first, new info last)
- Concision and Simplicity (remove needless words)

Feedback applied to create intro-v2.md:
- Removed 12 nominalizations (e.g., "demonstrated the ability to" → "can")
- Fixed subject-verb distance issues
- Simplified complex subjects
- Removed 15+ wordy phrases
- Result: 15% reduction (1150 → 980 words)

## 7. Citation Strategy with /citation-help

Slash command executed: /citation-help

Agent analyzed intro-v2.md for citation needs:
- Identified 21 uncited claims requiring attribution
- Recommended 25-40 citations total
- Prioritized critical citations:
  * Schultz et al. 1997 (dopamine as RPE)
  * Daw et al. 2005 (model-based/model-free)
  * NIBS meta-analyses in addiction
  * 3-5 examples of NIBS + cognitive tasks in addiction (CRITICAL for Para 4)
  * Computational psychiatry reviews

- Provided citation density recommendations by paragraph
- Suggested citation integration strategies (avoid citation strings)
- Identified critical verification need: Para 4 claims about studies combining NIBS + cognitive/computational assessment

## 8. Session Backup

Created SESSION-LOG.md to document entire workflow, decisions, and next steps for future sessions.

## Key Workflow Summary

1. Extract concepts from source PDFs (Q1: RLDM, Q2: NIBS) using Explore agents
2. Create synthesis strategy identifying overlapping/complementary/bridging concepts
3. Draft introduction using funnel structure (broad → narrow → gap → scope)
4. Review and revise using /writing-review (Duke principles)
5. Develop citation strategy using /citation-help
6. [Next: Verify Para 4 claims, gather citations, create final draft]

## Agents/Tools Used

- Task agent with Explore subagent (for reading large PDFs)
- /writing-review (Duke precision writing principles)
- /citation-help (citation gap analysis)
- Custom agents created:
  * /extract-concepts (extract key concepts from papers)
  * /synthesize-intro (synthesize multiple papers into introduction)
  * WORKFLOW-synthesis.md (3-phase workflow)
